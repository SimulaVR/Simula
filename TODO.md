Big list of TODOs and notes: 

# General
## Awful C++-esque typeclass structure. In most cases, `Some a` can be replaced with something better. However due to time/etc limitations, the current code architecture closely mirrors the simula_cpp one.
## hs-boot files due to the above. Annoying extra bookkeeping and should be phased out whenever possible.
## General stinginess with comments. In case something is unclear, chances are it's either unclear in the motorcar source and/or unclear to me (since it was ported from motorcar/simula_cpp). Ask anyways though.
## MVars are used whenever mutable state is required. This is not always needed, and I've attempted to reduce the amount of mutable references, but it's likely I missed some.

# Simula.NewCompositor
## .Event is basically unused. Weston handles all of that stuff.
## Geometry is mostly clean, apart from Rectangle being a misnomer (Rect is the actual Rectangle)
## OpenGL contains viewport code (relatively straightforward) and shader code (slightly suboptimal, as it compiled shaders too often; they should be cached)
## checkForErrors terminates the program on an OpenGL error with a backtrace; this can be deactivated by commentiong out the error line
## The scene graph is a big unholy mess of C++-esque code. It needs a massive refactoring.
## Gratitious use of RecursiveDo (aka mfix) to deal with <x needs reference of y, and vice versa, to be constructed> and superclass stuff. Could be solved by refactoring the above C++ mess.
## Generally, resources need to be cleaned up better. Consider ResourceT.
## The Weston surfaces currently don't have a type. This should be fixed.
## Weston.hs in general is a bit messy, and could use some cleaning up.
## The OSVR branch Weston.hs has modifications in the render loop and a reference to OSVR.hs' SimulaOSVRCLient. It should be merged back into the main branch.
