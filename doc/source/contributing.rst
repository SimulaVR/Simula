How to Contribute
=================

We're looking for open-source contributors. If you're interested in using Haskell to (cleanly) bring VR and Linux together, but don't have an HTC Vive, PM or email me at georgewsinger@gmail.com.

You can also see the `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/SimulaVR/Simula/issues/>`_ for a list of ways to immediately contribute. Issued may be tagged as *new contributor* if they are especially appropriate for people getting adjusted to the code. In addition, :ref:`developer-todo` sketches some additional issues with the code that may be solved via future contributions.
