Before you begin you must initialize and update the submodules in the `SimulaHS` repository.  This process ensures that you are in sync with previously checked in combinations of commits between the two projects. More information on submodules is [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).

``git submodule update --init --recursive``
