Detailed instructions on which git repositories are needed and special instructions for each one are given below. You will also need the Haskell `stack` tool available for download at [https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/]. Once all the dependencies are built and installed you can run `stack setup` followed by `stack build` in the top level of SimulaHS to get a build.

# Git Repos Needed -- In Order

1. wayland-protocols - [https://github.com/wayland-project/wayland-protocols]
  Currently HEAD is fine, but any tag >= 1.7 will work fine.

2. libweston - [https://github.com/wayland-project/weston]
  You will need to checkout tag `2.0.0`.

3. libfunctionality - [https://github.com/OSVR/libfunctionality]
  Currently HEAD is fine, previous versions not tested (2017-07-20).

4. folly - [https://github.com/facebook/folly]

5. OSVR-Core - [https://github.com/OSVR/OSVR-Core]
  Currently HEAD is fine, v0.6 does not build on debian stretch.

## System packages

### Dependencies for `wayland-protocols`

There are no special dependencies, but a pro-tip, run `configure` with a custom `PREFIX` and copy the `wayland-protocols.pc` file to `PREFIX/lib/pkgconfig` and set `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` to the same.

Example
    ./configure --prefix="$HOME"/.local
    make && make install
    cp wayland-protocols.pc "$HOME"/.local/lib/pkgconfig
    export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="$HOME"/.local/lib/pkgconfig

### Dependencies for `libweston`

Make sure you have installed `wayland-protocols` before proceeding to building `libweston`.

1. EGL - libegl1-mesa-dev
2. glesv2 - libgles2-mesa-dev
3. xcb-composite - libxcb-composite0-dev
4. xcursor - libxcursor-dev
5. cairo-xcb - libcairo2-dev
6. automatically install by libcairo2-dev - libpixman-1-dev
7. gbm - libgbm-dev
8. mtdev - libmtdev-dev
9. libinput - libinput-dev
10. xkbcommon - libxkbcommon-dev
11. pam - libpam0g-dev

After installing the above packages you can configure and build `libweston`. Here is a recipie for success:

    git checkout -b v2.0.0 2.0.0
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure --prefix="$HOME"/.local --disable-setuid-install
    make && make install

You will see a notice about needing to set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and also for setting `LD_RUN_PATH` to use these newly installed libraries. You may want to set these in your `.bashrc` file or other shell startup file. For your interactive shell you can just use the following lines:

    LIBDIR="$HOME"/.local/lib
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH":"$LIBDIR":"$LIBDIR"/libweston-2:"$LIBDIR"/weston
    export LD_RUN_PATH="$LD_RUN_PATH:"$LIBDIR":"$LIBDIR"/libweston-2:"$LIBDIR"/weston

### Dependencies for `libfunctionality`

You will need `cmake` to build any of the projects from `OSVR`. When building `cmake` projects you should perform out-of-tree builds by creating a build directory and running `cmake` from that directory. For example you can repeat this pattern for any cmake project:

    mkdir $PROJECT-build
    git clone $PROJECT_URI
    cd $PROJECT-build
    cmake ../$PROJECT

To set a custom `PREFIX` for cmake projects you need to use the following incantation.

    cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="$HOME"/.local ../$PROJECT

### Dependencies for `folly`

1. boost-context - libboost-context-dev
2. boost-chrono - libboost-chrono-dev
3. boost-filesystem - libboost-filesystem-dev
4. boost-regex - libboost-regex-dev
5. boost-program-options - libboost-program-options-dev
6. boost-system - libboost-system-dev
7. boost-thread - libboost-thread-dev
8. gflags - libgflags-dev
9. google-glog - libgoogle-glog-dev
10. libssl - libssl-dev
11. double-conversion - libdouble-conversion-dev
12. libevent - libevent-dev

To build folly you need to run `autoreconf -ivf` from the folly subdirectory of the cloned repository.

    cd folly
    autoreconf -ivf
    ./configure --prefix="$HOME"/.local
    make && make install

### Dependencies for `OSVR-Core`

To proceed ensure you have installed `folly`, `libfunctionality`, `libweston`, and `wayland-protocols` as described above.

1. sdl2 - libsdl2-dev
2. opencv - libopencv-dev
3. jsoncpp - libjsoncpp-dev
4. boost-thread - libboost-thread-dev
5. boost-locale - libboost-locale-dev
6. boost-filesystem - libboost-filesystem-dev
7. boost-program-options - libboost-program-options-deu
8. libusb - libusb-1.0-0-dev
9. libspdlog - libspdlog-dev

When fetching from github you must fetch the submodules and initialize them before attempting a build.
    git submodule update --init --recursive

OSVR-Core is a `cmake` project so refer to the instructions above in the `libfunctionality` section to perform an out-of-tree build.
