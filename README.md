Simula is a 3D window manager for Linux. 

![3 types of windows](./doc/3_types_of_windows.png)

**Mission:** Facilitate a Linux future for VR & AR Desktop. In the short-run, this means allowing people to run 2D Linux apps with current generation headsets. In the long-run, this means allowing people to run Linux in standalone AR & VR HMDs. Currently, Simula is aiming to be compatible with the HTC Vive. 

Project documentation with user and developer information is hosted at [simulavr.readthedocs.io](https://simulavr.readthedocs.io). Also you can peek in the *doc/source* directory for the raw reStructuredText files.

**Origins:** Simula is a reimplementation fork of [motorcar](https://github.com/evil0sheep/motorcar). To read about motorcar, see *[Toward General Purpose 3D User Interfaces: Extending Windowing Systems to Three Dimensions](https://github.com/evil0sheep/MastersThesis/blob/master/thesis.pdf?raw=true)*.

## Contributing

**Contributors:** We're looking for open-source contributors. If you're interested in using Haskell to (cleanly) bring VR and Linux together, but don't have an HTC Vive, PM or email me at georgewsinger@gmail.com.
